# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my repository of coding challenges and problems, where I've gathered a diverse collection of brain-teasers
from various sources!
As a passionate Java developer, I've meticulously solved each problem using innovative approaches that I'll be excited
to share with you.

To help you navigate through this treasure trove, I've organized the challenges and problems by their solution approach
and difficulty levels. And as a cherry on top, each solution comes with a concise description of the problem and my
creative thought process in solving it.

**Keep in mind that this repository is a work in progress**, and I'm constantly adding new challenges to it. So, be sure
to stay tuned and come back often for fresh and exciting brain-teasers!
